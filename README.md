# D3-Animation-Demo

Here's my test demo!  I combined two resources I found online:

pagePiling.js  -  http://alvarotrigo.com/pagePiling/ (Links to an external site.)

BrightPoint Radial Progress bars - http://www.brightpointinc.com/download/radial-progress-source-code/ (Links to an external site.)

pagePiling makes scrolling through pages work like slides, while the Radial Progress bar code does just that.  I made it so that the progress bars are rendered when the user scrolls with a mouse wheel with a slight delay so the animation doesn't occur off-screen.  The animation is triggered when scrolled with either the mouse wheel or the arrow keys.  Haven't figured out how to do it by clicking the navigation circles yet, but if I use this in my project, I will.
